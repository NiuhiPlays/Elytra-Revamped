Decided it took long enough for a mod like this comeback...

This mod is inspired by Aileron  
link: https://modrinth.com/mod/aileron

But now it's on Fabric 1.21.4

Made this mod in my free time and will continue updating the mod whenever I feel like.
I have more plans for this mod but most is purely cosmetic's.

The mod is purely server side and I want to keep it that way. It is meant to be used as a kinda nerf for the elytra so that horses and minecrafts stay relevant in the late game.
It also gives an oppertunity to make another transport infrastuctre with all the campfires.


Current Features:

- Fire and Campfires give the Player a Boost
- Campfires with Hay under them give an Extra boost + has a higher pickup range.

// I based these on the height of the smoke
// 10 for the normale campfire and 25 for the one with Haybales.

- The Soul Fire and Campfire both pull you down.

// Did not test this very well.

- The firework rockets are disabled in flight.

// I have plans for these later, also inspired by the Aileron mod.



Planned Features:

- Config options
- Tweaked default values
- Smoke flares?
- Bigger stacks of campfires bigger boost?
- maybe more?
