Decided it took long enough for a mod like this comeback...  

This mod is inspired by Aileron  
link: https://modrinth.com/mod/aileron  

But now it's on Fabric 1.21.4  

Made this mod in my free time and will continue updating the mod whenever I feel like.  
I have more plans for this mod but most is purely cosmetic's.  

The mod is purely server side and I want to keep it that way. It is meant to be used as a kinda nerf for the elytra so that horses and minecrafts stay relevant in the late game.  
It also gives an oppertunity to make another transport infrastuctre with all the campfires.  

Current Features include:  

Campfires boost Elytra players, with haybales underneath providing extra boost.  
Soul campfires pull players downward, with height-based effects.  
Firework rockets are disabled for Elytra propulsion.  
Firework rockets now create smoke flares instead.  
Visual and audible effects for Elytra flight.  
Controllable drag.   
Alot of configurability.  
Server-side only functionality.  

Planned Features include:  

YACL support for easier configuration.  
Debug mode.  
Optional client-side visual effects such as colored smoke trails and animated drag.
